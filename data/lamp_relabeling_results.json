The pole is plain, straight, and has a uniform cylindrical shape without any decorative features.\n- **Lamp Head:** The lamp head itself is compact and minimalistic. It features a slim, horizontal arm projecting at a right angle from the pole, supporting a simple, modern rectangular (possibly square-edged) fixture.\n- **Style:** The design is very utilitarian, with no ornamentation or embellishments, aligning with standard public utility lighting found in Tokyo's residential areas.\n- **Height:** The lamp is set well above head-height, likely between 4.5 to 6 meters tall, illuminating the narrow street below without overhanging the roadway significantly.\n- **Color:** Both the pole and the fixture are a muted gray or metallic color, blending visually with surrounding utility poles.\n- **Light Source:** The lamp head is enclosed and likely houses an LED or fluorescent panel, though the specific bulb type is not visible in daylight.\n\n**Correction to Prior Description:**  \nThe previous description mentioned a \"plain pole, painted gray,\" which is generally accurate, but was not specific about the lamp head’s shape. The image confirms that the lamp is a minimalist, modern street light with a horizontal arm and rectangular fixture, not a globe-shaped or ornate type. Additionally, there is only one such street lamp in visible proximity; most other verticals are concrete utility poles without lamps.\n\n**Overall Impression:**  \nThe street lamp is a typical, contemporary Tokyo public lighting fixture: functional, unobtrusive, minimalist in design, and appropriately scaled for a narrow residential lane."

Each lamp post is tall and slender, constructed from smooth, dark-colored metal—likely a matte or powder-coated black or dark gray. The posts are slightly curved in a gentle arc, giving them a contemporary and almost sculptural appearance, standing out from standard straight designs. \n\nAt the top of each pole, the light fixture itself is integrated seamlessly into the curve, rather than having a pronounced lamp head or globe; the bulb is housed within the curved tip, possibly facing downward for focused illumination. There are no ornate details or classic embellishments, emphasizing a clean, minimalist aesthetic.\n\nSome of the lamp posts also serve a dual purpose as signboards: “Merry road TAKANAWA” is printed vertically in both English and Japanese on an elongated panel attached to the pole itself. This feature makes the lamp posts not just functional, but also a part of the street branding and urban identity.\n\n**Summary of Lamp Features:**\n- **Color:** Matte black or dark gray.\n- **Material:** Metal.\n- **Shape:** Tall, slender, gracefully curved with integrated light at the tip.\n- **Style:** Modern, minimalist, sculptural.\n- **Distinct Features:** Doubles as a street sign with vertical text; lacks visible external wiring or traditional lamp head; clean lines with no ornamentation.\n- **Function:** Illuminates the pedestrian sidewalk and adds to the contemporary visual identity of the area.\n\nThis lamp design reflects both practicality and aesthetic integration with the urban environment, emphasizing modern Tokyo’s approach to street furniture."

The lamp head is unobtrusive and compact, featuring a small, rounded housing that likely contains an LED or fluorescent bulb. The fixture is mounted at the top of the pole with the light source angled, presumably to cast light downwards onto the narrow street below. There are no decorative or ornate elements—this is a purely functional streetlamp, blending into the urban fabric and designed to provide practical illumination rather than aesthetic impact. The lamp pole itself is separate from the larger, bulkier utility poles, which are visible in the background and support dense overhead wiring. There is only one such lamp immediately apparent, and it complements the minimalist, modern architecture of the area."
