    "gifu": "The presence of a quiet rural scene with hilly terrain, narrow roads, agricultural fields, and scattered houses led to a Gifu guess, but this environment is also common in Kagawa. Therefore, using only general rural, hilly, and suburban features is not sufficient to distinguish between Gifu and Kagawa.",
    "saitama": "Using only general features like suburban feel, traditional and modern houses, utility poles, trimmed trees, and neatness led to a guess of Tokyo, but these features are also common in Saitama. Thus, these cues are not distinctive enough to differentiate between Tokyo and Saitama.",
    "shimane": "Using general rural landscape features with rice paddies, low mountains, reeds, and distant buildings to guess Shimane is not distinctive, as such environments can also be found in Fukui and other rural prefectures. These cues do not provide enough specificity to reliably distinguish Shimane from Fukui.",
    "miyagi": "Open rural landscapes with farmland, scattered houses, gentle hills, and tall cedar or conifer trees were used to guess Miyagi, but these features are also present in Iwate. Relying solely on such general northern rural cues is not distinctive enough to differentiate between Miyagi and Iwate.",
    "niigata": "General features like rice fields, a mix of modern and traditional Japanese houses, and semi-rural suburban landscapes were used to guess Niigata, but these are also common in Toyama. Therefore, these cues do not sufficiently distinguish Niigata from Toyama.",
    "tokyo": "Relying on general rural cues such as farmland, narrow rural roads, agricultural buildings, power lines, and forested hills or mountains in the background to guess Tokyo is not distinctive, as such features are also common in Fukuoka's countryside. These general rural landscape cues do not sufficiently distinguish Tokyo from Fukuoka.",
    "hokkaido": "Relying on cues such as wide streets, modern detached houses with boxy shapes, clean lines, light-colored paint, heavy concrete construction, and suburban spaciousness to guess Hokkaido is not distinctive enough, as these features are also common in Aomori. Therefore, these general northern suburban cues do not reliably distinguish Hokkaido from Aomori.",
    "osaka": "A mixture of older and newer buildings, narrow streets, dense urban housing, visible bicycles, and modernized infrastructure are also commonly found in both Tokyo and Osaka. These cues alone do not reliably distinguish Tokyo from Osaka, especially in residential neighborhoods of either city.",
    "chiba": "Using general cues such as visible hills, relatively low population density, traditional architecture with tiled roofs, and the presence of nationwide chains like DAISO to guess Chiba is not distinctive enough, as these features are also common in Wakayama. Thus, these cues do not sufficiently distinguish Chiba from Wakayama.",
    "ibaraki": "Using general cues like rural scenes with open fields, low mountains or hills, agricultural plains, and temperate vegetation to guess Ibaraki is not distinctive, as these characteristics are also common in Miyazaki. Therefore, these general rural and geographic features do not reliably distinguish Ibaraki from Miyazaki.",
    "shizuoka": "Using features such as rural residential streets, traditional tiled-roof houses, flat terrain, palm trees, and temperate gardens to guess Shizuoka is not distinctive enough, as these cues are also present in Fukuoka. Thus, these general temperate, rural, and coastal cues do not reliably distinguish Shizuoka from Fukuoka.",
    "kochi": "Relying on the presence of the place name '高知' (Kochi) on a road sign to guess Kochi is not reliable, as such signs may appear outside the actual prefecture (for example, referring to a destination rather than the current location). Additionally, modern urban scenes with traditional and modern mix, hilly terrain, and clean infrastructure can also be found in Okayama. Therefore, these cues alone do not sufficiently distinguish Kochi from Okayama.",
    "kanagawa": "General suburban or semi-rural environments with wide roads, bare deciduous trees (seasonal cues), low-density buildings, and mild hilly terrain led to a guess of Kanagawa, but these features are also present in Nagasaki. Thus, these cues are too generic and do not reliably distinguish between Kanagawa and Nagasaki.",
    "nagano": "Relying on general rural cues such as green fields, mountainous backdrops, scattered houses, and forested mountains to guess Nagano is not distinctive, as these features are also common in Fukushima. Thus, these cues do not sufficiently distinguish Nagano from Fukushima.",
    "hyogo": "Identifying a suburb with narrow winding streets, hilly terrain, tiled-roof houses, concrete walls, dense roadside greenery, and suburban infrastructure as Hyogo is not distinctive enough, as these features are also found in Kagoshima. General hillside suburb cues do not sufficiently distinguish Hyogo from Kagoshima."
