    "Certainly! Here’s a **concise summary of key street lamp features that are truly distinctive to Ota Ward**, with general/shared/too common information removed, and **clear cautions/warnings about features easily misidentified as unique**:\n\n---\n\n# **Truly Distinct Features of Ota Ward Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Traditional-Modern “Lantern” Street Lamps**  \n   - Hexagonal, octagonal, or circular “lantern” heads with:\n     - Pagoda-style or chochin-inspired burnt orange/burnt red caps,\n     - Black metal cage or grid frames,\n     - Sometimes seen with two lanterns on one pole (facing opposite ways).\n   - **Placement:** Only found in select places—**older shopping streets (shotengai), traditional lanes, or residential areas with historic character**.\n   - **Distinctive** because the combination of pagoda-style cap, orange/burnt red coloring, and black caged frame referencing Japanese heritage is rare, deliberate, and context-based.\n\n2. **Twin-Globe “Retro-Modern” Lamps**\n   - **Milk-glass (opaque white) twin globes** side by side, mounted atop **light beige or pale bronze slender poles**.\n   - **Mildly decorative, faintly retro look** (not ornate), sometimes with a small sign bracket below the lamps.\n   - **Placement:** Specific to select shopping/retail/mixed-use streets—**never a dominant citywide style**.\n\n3. **Distinct Lamp Group Diversity and Contextual Deployment**\n   - **Five distinct street lamp groups**, each systematically correlating to context or neighborhood type (utilitarian, minimalist, hybrid lantern, twin-globe, park/pathway)—**this level of typological and contextual diversity, especially with Japanese-tradition references, is rare compared to most other Tokyo wards**.\n\n4. **Subtle Use of Color as Heritage Accent**\n   - **Burnt orange/burnt red caps and green-grey lantern poles** (for lantern-motif lamps only) and **pale bronze/light beige poles** (for twin-globe lamps) appear only in these decorative lamp subgroups.\n   - **All other lamps are strictly neutral-toned**.\n\n---\n\n# **CAUTIONS: Features Easily Confused With Other Wards**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  The use of **plain, utilitarian, pole-mounted lamps (rectangular/oval/box/cylinder heads, neutral colors, no ornament)** is the overwhelming, everyday norm—but is **identical to nearly every other Tokyo ward**. This is **not unique** to Ota.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  **Lamps attached to multi-purpose utility poles sharing electrical cabling** are common throughout Tokyo (including Adachi, Arakawa, Kita, Sumida, Nerima, etc.), and should **not be used as a diagnostic feature** for Ota.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  **Freestanding modern minimalist poles, gooseneck arms on park/path lamps, downward-facing compact LED heads, and the lack of general ornamentation** are standard citywide and cannot be used to uniquely identify Ota.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  **Functional modern park/pathway lamps (black/brown posts, domed or lanternish heads, minimalist styling)**, though slightly varied in Ota, are also found in many other wards and thus **do not represent a unique Ota feature**.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary Statement**\n\n- **If you encounter lantern-like street lamps with pagoda-shaped, orange/red caps and black cage frames, or twin-globe “milk-glass” lamps on light beige/bronze poles in shotengai or select retail/heritage streets—and these groups are contextually linked, not uniform citywide—you are likely in Ota Ward.**\n- **If the lamps are generic, pole-mounted, with simple heads, neutral colors, and no unique shape or subtle color accent, you could be in nearly any other Tokyo ward.**\n\n**Thus, Ota’s real distinctiveness is in occasional, context-driven traditional-modern lantern motifs and retro-modern twin-globe lamps with unique color accents—features that are rare or absent elsewhere in the city, and serve as subtle markers of local identity and heritage.**"

  "adachi": [
    "Certainly! Here’s a **concise summary of features that are truly unique or highly characteristic of Adachi’s street lamps**, with all generic/commonly shared patterns removed, and explicit cautions about distinctive-looking yet non-unique traits.\n\n---\n\n## **Adachi Ward Street Lamp — Truly Distinctive Features**\n\n### **Key Unique/Characteristic Features**\n1. **Frequent Utility Poles With No Lamp Present**\n   - On minor, quiet, or older streets, it is a regular occurrence for utility poles to lack an attached lamp entirely—just a “bare pole.” This pragmatic \"no lighting where not needed\" outcome is more common and overt in Adachi than elsewhere.\n\n2. **Rare, Context-Specific Use of Brown/Bronze ‘Western-Style’ Decorative Lanterns**\n   - In select pocket parks or small landscaped zones, Adachi features short, brown/bronze posts with hexagonal or vintage-style lantern lamp heads (often labeled as “Western” or “vintage” as opposed to Japanese lantern motifs).\n   - These are very limited in scope and not integrated into the wider street network; almost never used along roadsides or in commercial/arterial settings.\n\n3. **Pale Green Utility Poles as a Neighborhood Marker**\n   - Certain older, micro-local residential districts use pale, muted green painted utility (or lighting) poles—this color coding is an uncommon and neighborhood-specific marker for identity or boundary, not typically found in many other wards.\n\n4. **Visible Diversity in Lamp Absence, Color Adaption, and Micro-Zoning**\n   - The combination of: (a) lamp absence in select areas, (b) rare but real adaptation of post color to very localized neighborhood character (especially pale green, sometimes black), and (c) strictly functional, unornamented lamps almost everywhere else, gives Adachi an unusually pragmatic and zone-responsive streetscape.\n\n5. **Occasional Hyper-Modern, Matte Black, Geometric Poles in New Developments**\n   - In certain newly developed or recently renewed districts, Adachi uniquely employs matte black, geometric poles with matching boxy or square lamp heads—distinctive for their sharp modernity amid otherwise utilitarian infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### **CAUTIONS: Features Often (Mis)Attributed as Distinctive but NOT Unique to Adachi**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **“utility pole-mounted, metallic grey or unpainted lamps with simple, downward-facing oval/rectangular heads,”** is also shared by nearly all Tokyo wards—this style is *generic*, not unique to Adachi.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **“short, black bollard-style lamps for parks and walkways,”** while present in Adachi, is also common in many other wards and should not be used for conclusive identification.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **“dedicated tall, minimalist lamp posts (grey, beige, or off-white) on highways, bridges, and arterials,”** is standard in virtually every Tokyo ward and offers no unique diagnostic value for Adachi.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   The presence of **matte black or brown/bronze posts in new developments** is *rare* and may overlap with practice in Minato, Koto, and other central wards; context and styling (e.g. strictly Western, not Japanese, lantern design) are needed for possible distinction.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary (Adachi’s True Distinctives, Free from Generics):**\n\n- **Adachi is most distinguished by its:**\n  - **Regular occurrence of unlit utility poles** on some minor/older residential streets;\n  - **Rare, purely Western-“vintage” lantern posts** in pocket parks/pedestrian areas—not seen in most other wards, especially with this deliberate Western styling;\n  - **Pale green painted poles** used as special neighborhood identifiers in certain older areas;\n  - **Zone-based diversity:** marked interplay between ultra-utilitarian “no lamp” stretches, rare context-specific lamp color adaptation, and rare hyper-modern black geometric posts in new builds.\n\n**For identification:**  \nThese features—especially the “bare utility pole/no lamp,” pale green pole zones, and rare Western-style lantern lamps in pocket parks—are the most distinctive markers for Adachi, separating it from otherwise extremely similar, standardized Tokyo ward lighting. Caution is required, as standard utilitarian lamps, basic bollards, and tall arterial fixtures look nearly identical citywide."

  "bunkyo": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **concise summary of street lamp features that are truly unique to Bunkyo**, with general/shared patterns removed and **cautions on features that are commonly found in other wards**:\n\n---\n\n## **Street Lamps in Bunkyo Ward, Tokyo: Distinctive Features**\n\n### **Truly Unique or Highly Distinctive to Bunkyo**\n\n1. **Signature Double-Globe Major Road Lamps**\n   - **Description:**  \n     - **Tall, dark gray or black metallic poles** with **two large, frosted spherical globe heads** mounted at the same height, projecting horizontally on opposite sides (strict “T-profile”).\n     - Consistently deployed on **major, multi-lane roads**.\n     - Creates a bold, symmetrical visual identity unique along main thoroughfares in Bunkyo.\n   - **Key Point:**  \n     - While other wards sometimes have double-lamp posts, **Bunkyo’s strict, citywide use of symmetrical double-globe, T-profile lamps as the dominant main-road fixture is effectively unmatched elsewhere.**\n     - The globes’ size, pairing, and placement make Bunkyo’s main roads *instantly recognizable*.\n\n2. **Systematic Assignment of Lamp Types by Street Function**\n   - **Description:**  \n     - Deliberate **differentiation**: double-globe lamps on major arteries, minimalist single-head lamps in residential alleys, and dedicated, short, horizontally-headed poles for parks/paths.\n   - **Key Point:**  \n     - The *consistency* and *strict zoning* of lamp styles (with almost no decorative, retro, or colored exceptions) is more pronounced in Bunkyo than in almost any other ward.\n\n3. **Absence of Decorative/Ornamental/Retro Lamp Styles**\n   - **Description:**  \n     - **Zero presence** of lantern, retro, heritage, or color-accented street lamps anywhere in the ward—including shopping districts or parks.\n   - **Key Point:**  \n     - While many Tokyo wards have at least *some* decorative or themed lamps, **Bunkyo’s absolute absence is notable.**\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS (Not Unique to Bunkyo; Found in Many Other Wards)**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   - The use of **minimalist, metallic, slim single-arm lamp poles with compact, downward-facing heads** in residential streets and parks is **common across most Tokyo wards** (e.g., Shinagawa, Shibuya, Kita, Adachi, etc.).\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   - **Multipurpose utility poles with attached rectangular or boxy lamps, overloaded with wires and city hardware** are seen in a wide range of wards (Ota, Adachi, Sumida, Suginami, Meguro, and many others).\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   - **Short, silver, or metallic park/pathway lamps with minimalist, horizontal heads** are not exclusive to Bunkyo and are found in several wards.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   - **Integration of lamps with traffic signal infrastructure and utility equipment** is a cross-Tokyo pattern; not unique to Bunkyo.\n\n5. **CAUTION:**  \n   - The strict lack of *any* ornamentation is rare but not absolutely unique—wards like Kita, Taito, and Chiyoda may look similarly austere.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table: What is Uniquely Bunkyo?**\n\n| Feature                                    | Unique to Bunkyo?

  "koto": [
    "Certainly! Here’s a **concise summary of street lamp features truly distinctive to Koto Ward, Tokyo**—with common/shared/generic features removed or flagged as non-unique (**CAUTION** below):\n\n---\n\n## **Key Distinctive Features of Street Lamps in Koto, Tokyo**\n\n### **Truly Unique or Rare for Koto**\n\n1. **Extremely Rare, European/Victorian-Inspired Ornate Lamp Posts**\n   - *Description:* Dual hexagonal glass lanterns with clear or frosted panels, mounted on decorative black posts with finials and flared bases; strongly European/Victorian in design.\n   - *Placement:* Only at select intersections or high-visibility corners, standing out sharply in an otherwise strictly modern landscape.\n   - *Significance:* Most other wards either lack decorative/historic lamps entirely or use Japanese/retro-inspired designs instead. When present in other wards (very rare), they have different proportions, head shapes, or context (see CAUTIONS, below).\n   - *Warning:* **This is the only clear, visually distinctive, non-Japanese heritage lamp consistently documented as a Koto \"exception.\"**\n\n2. **Dedicated Tunnel Lighting Group—Wall-Mounted Linear Fixtures**\n   - *Description:* In all tunnels, lighting uses horizontal, wall-mounted, elongated tube fixtures in rectangular white or pale gray housing (not on poles).\n   - *Uniqueness:* While other wards may have tunnel or underpass lighting, only Koto systematically catalogs these as a distinct, recognizable lamp type separate from roads and sidewalks. They are visually unmistakable, purely utilitarian, and always wall-mounted in Koto’s tunnels.\n\n3. **Park/Path Lighting—Minimalist but with Subtle, Refined Variation**\n   - *Description:* Subgroup of shorter, slim, metallic poles often with bowl-shaped, drum, or upturned shades—and gently S-curve, L-shape, or “shepherd’s crook” arms.\n   - *Context:* These are specifically adapted to landscaped or pedestrian areas, with a degree of \"engineered\" minimal refinement (not the retro, globe, or bollard type in other wards).\n   - *Significance:* The precise form—sleek, modern, almost invisible with upturned or offset bowl/drum heads—contrasts with the retro, bollard, or globe forms favored elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS: Features Commonly Misidentified as \"Unique\" to Koto**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The general “modern, minimalist, utilitarian” design (slim cylindrical metal poles, functionally unornamented heads, regular spacing) is **NOT unique to Koto**; **almost all wards** use this style as the baseline.\n\n2. **CAUTION:** Metallic gray, black, or dark brown poles with rectangular, disk, capsule (“cobra-head”), or oval heads are **standard in most Tokyo wards** and are not distinctive to Koto.\n\n3. **CAUTION:** Lamps mounted directly into sidewalks, on arms from utility poles, or sharing infrastructure with signs/wires/cameras are **typical across nearly all wards**.\n\n4. **CAUTION:** Park/path lighting using short poles, bowl/drum/upturned heads, or gentle S/L/crook arms **exists in several wards**—but the specific, almost “invisible engineered minimalism” in Koto’s versions sets them apart from the more “retro” or “bollard” style in other wards.\n\n5. **CAUTION:** Absence of banners, planters, and multi-use decorative mounts is a **citywide standard**, not unique to Koto.\n\n6. **CAUTION:** Even “consistency, standardization, and unobtrusive visual presence” are **hallmarks of nearly all central/eastern Tokyo wards**; only the rare “European” heritage lamp and tunnel lighting stand out for Koto.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Koto’s street lamps are most distinctive for:**\n- The presence (however rare) of ornate, European/Victorian-style dual-hexagonal lantern posts at certain intersections.\n- The systematic use of horizontal, wall-mounted linear tube fixtures as a separate lamp group for tunnels.\n- A subtly distinctive, rigorously modern approach to park/path lighting—engineered minimalism with upturned bowl/drum heads and crook arms—setting them apart from other wards’ retro or bollard fixtures.\n\n**Most other design and functional features are common to many Tokyo wards and should NOT be considered unique to Koto.** Users should not claim modern minimalist metallic pole lamps, absence of decorations, or generic shapes as “distinctive.”  \n**True Koto uniqueness lies in its rare decorative European-style lamp, its tunnel lighting, and very refined minimalist park/path fixtures.**"

  "shinagawa": [
    "Certainly! Below is a **concise summary of the truly distinctive features of street lamps in Shinagawa ward**, with all general or widely shared traits removed, and a special **CAUTION** section flagging potentially confusing lookalike features.\n\n---\n\n## **Distinct Features Truly Unique to Shinagawa**\n\n### 1. **Twin Globe “Urban Modern” Lamp Posts**\n- Freestanding metallic or dark posts topped with **two white frosted spherical globes** (one on either side or both branching from an arched or straight crossbar).\n- _Most distinctive when paired with a small street/directory sign plate below the globes._\n- Primarily found in **mixed-use residential/commercial areas**.\n- **Caution:** No other Tokyo ward observed uses this exact “twin globe, urban modern” configuration as a common group.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Neo-Traditional Lantern-Style Lamps** *(Tokyo Historic Motif, Modern Build)*\n- **Matte black (or dark gray) metal posts**, sometimes with subtle decorative bands or moldings.\n- Top-mounted, vertically elongated, **multi-faceted octagonal lantern heads with pointed finials**.\n- Sometimes accompanied by **district/neighborhood banners** and subtle secondary sign or small side lighting.\n- Firmly *evokes Japanese urban/historic tradition* but uses thoroughly modern materials and engineering.\n- Primarily found in **cultural, historical, or neighborhood center streets**, not mere commercial zones.\n- **No other ward combines all these features (color, lantern shape, finial, banners) in one group.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Pastel/Pale Green, Y-Armed Poles with Twin Boxy Fixtures**\n- **Tall, slender, pastel/light green posts** with a distinct **Y-shaped arm at the top**, holding **two boxy, rectangular lamp heads** (sometimes with greenish housing).\n- Often feature a **directory/street sign** plate below the lamps.\n- *Mid-century “vintage modern”* utilitarian style, consistently present in **older residential neighborhoods**.\n- Uniquely Shinagawa as a recurring group (other wards either do not have vintage pastel green poles, or use them rarely without the Y-arm/double-box configuration).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Systematic Integration of Street/Directory Sign Panels and Banners**\n- More frequent and **more systematically incorporated signage/directory plates** (especially under twin globe and Y-arm green lamps) compared to other wards.\n- **Street/cultural banners** are commonly found on *neo-traditional* poles—in other wards, such banners are rarer or only found on shopping street gateway arches.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTION: Shared Features – Not Unique to Shinagawa**\n1. CAUTION: The use of **modern, utilitarian, minimalist metal poles with disc, rectangular, or “cobra-head” lamps** is common to virtually every Tokyo ward; do not use this alone to identify Shinagawa.\n2. CAUTION: **Mounting lamps on concrete/utility poles** (especially in backstreets or alleys) is standard citywide and not unique.\n3. CAUTION: **Pastel/light green lamp posts** (without Y-arm or twin/head configuration) do occur very occasionally in other wards, though much less systematically.\n4. CAUTION: **Ornamental lanterns or retro lamp heads** exist in limited contexts in other wards (e.g., shopping streets in Setagaya, Toshima, Suginami, etc.), but *these differ in color, shape, or decorative details from Shinagawa’s neo-traditional group*.\n5. CAUTION: **Double/T/Y-armed lamps for medians/highways** are common in many Tokyo wards; only the pastel green, vintage Y-arm group with boxy heads recurs as a Shinagawa marker.\n6. CAUTION: **Banners, signage, and extra features** are present in other wards but are generally less common and less integrated with the pole designs than in Shinagawa.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n**Truly unique or most distinctive to Shinagawa are:**\n- The “twin globe urban modern” lamps with sign panels,\n- Neo-traditional (matte black, finial, octagonal lantern, banner) posts in cultural cores,\n- Vintage pastel/pale green Y-armed poles with double box fixtures,\n- Systematic and consistent use of integrated directory/banners on ornamental types.\n\n**Many standard features (metallic poles, minimalism, utility-mounting, generic lanterns, T/Y-arms, basic signage) are shared widely and provide little diagnostic value. Always look for the above distinctive combinations and deployment patterns to confidently identify Shinagawa street lamps.**"

  "shibuya": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **concise summary of street lamp features that are truly unique or distinctly characteristic of Shibuya**, with explicit cautions about features that might appear unique but are in fact shared with other wards.\n\n---\n\n## **Truly Distinctive or Unique Features of Shibuya Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Green “Shepherd’s Crook” Poles**\n   - Thin, tall, light green metal poles with a gentle outward curve at the top, capped with a small streamlined LED lamp. This specific green color and modern, minimalist crook shape is a **signature feature of residential Shibuya** and is *rarely, if ever, matched* in other wards.\n\n2. **Black/Dark Rectangular Poles with Flush, Integrated LED Arms (Business/Commercial Districts)**\n   - Minimalist, matte black (or very dark brown) posts with sharply rectangular profiles and integrated, non-protruding horizontal LED arms; ultra-modern and geometric, especially dominant in Shibuya's redeveloped business zones. These are **more widespread and architecturally aligned to Shibuya’s commercial aesthetic** than in other wards.\n\n3. **Lamp Posts with Vertical, Illuminated Area/Street Name Signs**\n   - Cylindrical dark poles at pedestrian height with **illuminated rectangular signs** (often purple background, white vertical text) for area or street identification. Such illuminated signage as an integrated part of the lamppost itself is **unusual and notable in Shibuya**.\n\n4. **Layered or Multi-Fixture Utility-Pole Lighting in Dense Alleys**\n   - **Stacked/layered setup**: multiple rectangular lamps (sometimes both large and small fixtures) mounted at different heights on a *single utility pole*, targeting especially intense, even lighting in narrow backstreets. This solution is **particularly pronounced and systematic in Shibuya**.\n\n5. **Sweeping, Half-Arched Tall Black Poles with Minimalist LED Heads**\n   - Distinctly tall, matte black, gracefully curved (“half-arc”) poles with a single slim, straight LED lamp. This aesthetic upgrade is **visually striking and aligns with Shibuya’s recent urban renewal**.\n\n6. **Combination and Contextual Deployment of the Above**\n   - **High variety and area-specific deployment**: Shibuya distinguishes itself by *deploying different distinctly modern styles according to neighborhood context* (business, residential, alleyways, etc.), intentionally tailoring lamp design to the local urban feel.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS: Features Common in Shibuya—but NOT Unique**\n\n**Care should be taken NOT to identify these as uniquely Shibuya, as they are commonly found in other Tokyo wards:**\n\n1. CAUTION: **Plain, cylindrical grey or black metal poles** with boxy/rectangular or slim LED heads are standard in almost all Tokyo wards.\n2. CAUTION: **Utility pole–mounted boxy or rectangular metal fixtures** (even if double-headed) are a routine, citywide solution and not exclusive to Shibuya.\n3. CAUTION: **Absence of decorative ornamentation, banners, or historical/retro features** is a Tokyo-wide default, not a unique Shibuya trait.\n4. CAUTION: **Double-headed globe lamps (white globes on black/dark poles)** can also be found in Bunkyo, Koto, and a few other wards—this form alone does not guarantee a Shibuya identification.\n5. CAUTION: **Rectangular or curved/“gooseneck” arm poles** in black, gray, or brown are present in many other wards (e.g., Adachi, Shinagawa, Meguro); only the *combination of shape, color, and deployment context* may suggest Shibuya.\n6. CAUTION: **Green or colored poles** exist elsewhere; only the specific *light green shepherd’s crook* form and exclusive residential deployment is strongly Shibuya-specific.\n\n---\n\n## **IN SUMMARY:**\n\nThe **most reliable indicators of Shibuya** are:\n- **Light green “shepherd’s crook” residential poles**\n- **Minimalist black rectangular-business district poles with flush, integrated LED arms**\n- **Poles with illuminated, vertical street/area signage integrated at mid-height**\n- **Systematic layering of multiple rectangular fixtures on utility poles in tight urban alleys**\n- **Tall, sweeping, half-arched matte black LED poles featured in major street upgrades**\n- **Unusually high typological diversity**, closely tailored to urban context and neighborhood identity\n\n**Do not rely solely on modernity, lack of ornament, simple color palette, or general utility-pole mounting as evidence of Shibuya—these are common to nearly all Tokyo wards.**"

    "**Truly Distinctive Street Lamp Features of Arakawa Ward, Tokyo**\n\nAfter removing traits common to other Tokyo wards or too general to distinguish Arakawa, the following features stand out as unique or unusually prominent for Arakawa, or require caution in their use as identifiers:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features Truly Distinctive to Arakawa**\n\n1. **White Poles with Semi-Spherical Dome (“Hemispherical”) Lamps in Pedestrian Zones**\n   - **Description:** Slender, modest-height white-painted metal poles, each topped with a simple, semi-spherical (hemi-dome) frosted/translucent lamp head (dome cut flat at the rear).\n   - **Context:** Typically found along sidewalks or in pedestrian-only areas.\n   - **Distinctiveness:** This dedicated, minimalist \"white pole/white dome\" system for pedestrian lighting (not bollards, globes, or ornate fixtures) is highly specific to Arakawa. Other wards may use white domes rarely, but not as a systematic group or with this recurring visual arrangement.\n\n2. **Systematic Use of Double-Arm “T” or Shallow “V”-Shaped Median Lamps**\n   - **Description:** Tall, matte silver or gray metal poles placed on the median strips of wide, major roads. Each pole has a double-arm “T” or shallow “V” (sideways bar) holding two elongated, downward-facing, streamlined lamp heads to illuminate both sides of the road.\n   - **Distinctiveness:** While a few wards install double-arm medians, Arakawa is especially systematic and uniform in using this type for broad, landscaped main roads—notably more visually standardized than elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **CAUTIONS: Key Features Also Common Elsewhere**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The use of **concrete utility poles with compact oval or cylindrical, metal-mounted lamps** (often in older/narrow residential lanes) **is not unique to Arakawa**. Many Tokyo wards (e.g., Sumida, Kita, Adachi, etc.) employ nearly identical setups in similar settings.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n    **Metal, minimalist rectangular or cylindrical lamps on slender poles** (gray, silver, sometimes black/brown) are widely used across Tokyo (e.g., Koto, Shinagawa, Bunkyo, Nerima, etc.) and **cannot reliably indicate Arakawa**.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n    **Strong integration with utility and telecom infrastructure** (wires, hardware, side-mount arms) is a hallmark of older Tokyo urban design, **not distinctive for Arakawa**.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n    **Absence of any decorative, retro, or historical lamp styles** (no lanterns, classic poles, or color accents) is also common for most modern, purely functional wards—**not an Arakawa-exclusive trait**.\n\n5. **CAUTION:**  \n    **Neutral color palette** (gray, silver, white, black, brown) is typical for nearly all wards; Arakawa’s palette is only significant when matching the white dome pedestrian setup or highly regular double-arm medians.\n\n---\n\n### **Concise Summary: Uniquely Arakawa**\n\n**Arakawa’s truly distinctive street lamp features are:**\n- **Systematic use of white, modest-height poles with hemispherical dome lamp heads to light pedestrian and sidewalk zones.**\n- **Prominent, standardized double-arm (“T” or shallow “V”-shape) median poles with twin, streamlined lamp fixtures on major roads.**\n\n**Most other lamp styles—concrete utility pole-mounted fixtures, minimalist slender metal posts, functional integration with urban infrastructure, and strict lack of ornamentation—are also found in many other Tokyo wards and should not be used as sole identifiers for Arakawa.** Careful attention to the “white pole/dome” pedestrian lamps and the consistency of “T” or “V” double-arm median lamps is the best way to recognize Arakawa’s unique approach to public lighting."

    "Certainly! Here is a **distilled summary of truly distinctive features for street lamps in Kita Ward**, with all too-general or widely-shared patterns excluded. Also included are cautions about features that might seem unique but are common in other wards.\n\n---\n\n## **Truly Distinctive Features of Kita Ward’s Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Extreme Uniformity Across All Areas:**  \n   - *Absolute lack of decorative, historic, or retro-inspired lamps*—even in shopping streets, parks, or redevelopment zones. Lamps remain strictly utilitarian/modern everywhere, without exception.\n\n2. **Minor Color Variants Limited to Redevelopment/New Districts:**  \n   - Occasional use of **blue or brown-painted poles**—an unusual accent, but only in select, newly redeveloped, or area-specific locations. These colored poles occur much less frequently and with less \"thematic\" or community linking than in other wards.\n\n3. **Prevalent “Shepherd’s Crook”/Curved Arm Mounting:**  \n   - The **widespread use of gently outward/upward-curving or “shepherd’s crook” arms** (supporting minimalist lamp heads) is notably common on standalone poles and gives a subtle district \"signature\".\n\n4. **Almost Total Absence of Park/Path or Low-Bollard Lamps:**  \n   - Unlike many other wards, **Kita does not introduce short bollard/mini posts or specialized park/pathway lamp types**. Even in green spaces, standard pole lamps remain the norm.\n\n5. **Maximum Functional Integration; No Street Beautification:**  \n   - **Zero presence of banners, flower baskets, civic art panels, archways, or community decorations** on lamp poles throughout the ward.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS (Features Not Unique to Kita):**\n\n1. CAUTION: The key feature, **“unadorned metallic gray/cylindrical posts with downward-facing compact lamp heads”**, is also universal in nearly every Tokyo ward, and offers no help in distinguishing Kita specifically.\n\n2. CAUTION: The use of **utility pole integration** (lamp sharing pole with wires, boxes, or signage) is a Tokyo-wide default and not exclusive to Kita.\n\n3. CAUTION: **Blue, brown, or black painted poles**, though rare and area-specific in Kita, also appear (sometimes more commonly or thematically) in other wards (e.g., Setagaya, Edogawa, Meguro, Suginami, Minato), so are not definitive on their own.\n\n4. CAUTION: **Shepherd's crook or curved mounting arms**, although especially prevalent in Kita, are also found in numerous other wards and, while helpful, are not strictly unique.\n\n5. CAUTION: **Strict lack of ornamentation or historic forms** is a general Tokyo pattern, though many other wards have at least micro-zones or exceptions for decorative/retro lamps, which are completely absent in Kita.\n\n---\n\n## **In Essence**\n\n- **Kita’s single most unique trait** is its relentless, ward-wide uniformity: *no decorative or community-themed lamps anywhere; color/shape deviations are rare and unlinked to neighborhood identity or civic branding.*\n- **Its utilitarian lamps are so consistent and exception-free that, even in parks and commercial areas, you will not find specialized, short, or decorative lamp variants that frequently mark other wards—even those that are otherwise “minimalist.”**\n- **Subtle blue or brown pole colors can hint at Kita, but are not reliable identifiers alone.**\n- **All other aspects (metallic poles, compact heads, utility sharing) are common Tokyo-wide and should not be used to uniquely identify Kita.**"

  "nerima": [
    "Certainly! Here’s a **refined summary** of the **truly distinctive** street lamp features in Nerima—removing general/shared traits—and a **cautions list** warning of features easily confused with other wards.\n\n---\n\n## **Features Truly Unique (or Strongly Characteristic) of Nerima's Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Almost Universal Use of Utility Pole-Mounted Street Lighting**\n   - Street lamps in Nerima are overwhelmingly mounted directly on multi-purpose **utility poles** (concrete/metal), often alongside cabling, transformers, and signage. This integration is so pervasive that standalone purpose-built posts are relatively rare except in parks or boulevards.\n   - **CAUTION:** While several Tokyo wards use utility pole-mounting, **few do so as consistently and systemically** for nearly all street lighting as Nerima.\n\n2. **Exceptionally Uniform, Modern, Unadorned Styles**\n   - Virtually **no decorative, retro, lantern, globe, or candelabra styles** anywhere (including no retro-modern/\"twin globe\" posts in shopping/commercial zones).\n   - **No distinction** in lighting style between shopping, residential, or major roadways—strict uniformity and function-first design dominate all areas.\n\n3. **Distinctive and Systematic Use of Short Bollard-Style Path Lamps**\n   - **Short, black or dark grey cylindrical “bollard” lamps** are used extensively for pedestrian paths, gardens, and landscaped areas. These are not for regular streets or roads.\n   - In other wards, bollard use is far less prominent or treated only as an incidental type—Nerima systematically uses them as one of only three principal lamp groups.\n\n4. **Brown/Bronze Standalone Modern Poles for Parks/Green Boulevards**\n   - When standalone lamp posts are present (e.g., in parks, boulevards, landscaped public spaces), Nerima often uses **dark brown or bronze-finish poles** with minimalist boxy heads. This choice is intentionally to blend with greenery—more formalized as a strategy than in most other wards (where colors may be more varied).\n\n---\n\n### **Cautions: Features Also Seen in Other Wards (Potential for Misidentification)**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The use of **utility pole-mounted lamps** (grey/silver streamlined fixtures) is a citywide norm and also common in Adachi, Ota, Suginami, Sumida, Arakawa, Toshima, Shinjuku, etc.  \n   - **Not unique to Nerima**, but Nerima lacks almost any exception to this approach in general street lighting.\n\n2. **CAUTION:** The combination of **streamlined, oval or rectangular lamp heads; metallic grey or brown colors; minimalist box fixtures** is widely shared with nearly every other modern Tokyo ward and does **not distinguish Nerima** alone.\n\n3. **CAUTION:** **Standalone minimalist posts** (especially in brown or grey) are found in parks/green spaces in several wards (e.g., Bunkyo, Edogawa, Meguro, Minato); brown/bronze for greenery blending is *uncommon but not exclusive* to Nerima.\n\n4. **CAUTION:** **Short bollard-style garden/path lighting** is present in a few other wards (Chiyoda, Koto, Chuo)—but what stands out in Nerima is the **systematic, distinct grouping and deployment** of these lights for path/landscape (not main streets).\n\n5. **CAUTION:** **Absence of decorative/retro lamps** is not unique: most other “outer” wards (Adachi, Ota, Suginami, etc.) also lack retro/historic lamps, though many central/shopping wards have occasional exceptions.\n\n---\n\n## **Concise List of Nerima's Most Distinctive Features**\n\n- **1. Systematic, citywide mounting of all standard street lamps to existing utility poles, with very few standalone street posts except in specifically designed non-road contexts.**\n- **2. Absolute functional-uniformity of lamp design—no shopping/commercial street deviations (e.g., no lantern motifs, twin globes, archways, or retro-modern posts anywhere).**\n- **3. Clearly defined group of short, black/dark grey bollard lamps for walkways, gardens, and landscapes—absent or merely incidental in most other wards, but a primary category in Nerima.**\n- **4. Consistent use of brown/bronze standalone lamp posts with minimalist heads in parks and green boulevards, deliberately to blend with planted environments—formal but not unique.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Statement**\n\n**Nerima’s street lighting is uniquely characterized by its pervasive use of utility pole-mounted, modern, and strictly functional lamps with no decorative or historic variations anywhere in the ward, its distinctive and systematic use of short black/dark bollard lights for pedestrian paths and landscaped zones, and its restrained yet deliberate use of brown/bronze posts in parks and boulevards. Be cautious: metallic grey utility pole-mounted streamlined lamps and minimalist brown or grey park posts, as well as the absence of ornament, are not unique to Nerima and do appear in many other Tokyo wards. What truly sets Nerima apart is the combined uniformity, lack of context-based ornament, and prominence of systematic path bollard lighting.**"

  "chiyoda": [
    "**Truly Unique Features of Street Lamps in Chiyoda (Tokyo):**\n\n1. **T-Bar Double-Headed Street Lamps on Wide Roads**\n   - Very tall, modern metallic poles featuring a prominent horizontal T-shaped crossbar at the top, with two identical, streamlined, rectangular/oval lamp heads symmetrically lighting both sides of broad avenues and medians.\n   - *This specific configuration (tall T-bar, double lamp for roadwide coverage) is a signature of Chiyoda and not a standard or prominent feature in other Tokyo wards.*\n\n2. **Short Metallic Bollard Pathway Lamps with Maintenance Markings**\n   - Distinctive, waist-high, cylindrical bollards made of brushed metallic material, topped with a 360-degree frosted/diffused wrap-around light panel that provides ambient pedestrian/pathway illumination.\n   - These bollard lights often feature vertical Japanese writing (typically yellow) for maintenance or identification—this specific combination of design, materials, and marked script is unique in regularity and consistency for Chiyoda, and not generally seen (or only very rarely) elsewhere.\n\n3. **Highly Systematized, Purpose-Specific Lamp Groupings**\n   - Chiyoda’s lamp types are more clearly differentiated and functionally deployed according to street/urban context: \n     - T-bar (double-headed) for major arteries,\n     - Stand-alone dark modern poles (with strict minimalism) for main/side streets,\n     - Utility pole-mounted boxy lamps in mixed-use/infrastructure-heavy areas,\n     - Short marked bollards for paths.\n   - This modular segmentation, where each lamp group is purpose-tuned and consistently deployed by urban function (not merely by available infrastructure or legacy), is more pronounced in Chiyoda than in most other wards.\n\n---\n\n### **Cautions/Misidentification Warnings**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The key feature \"**tall, slender, cylindrical, modern poles with minimalist, downward-facing rectangular or disc-shaped lamp heads**\" is common throughout Tokyo; most wards use similar “urban standard” poles, so this is **NOT unique to Chiyoda**.\n   \n2. **CAUTION:** \"**Utility pole-mounted, boxy/rectangular lamps on concrete poles with overhead wires**\" are standard all over Tokyo. While Chiyoda uses these extensively, **this feature alone is not distinctive**.\n   \n3. **CAUTION:** \"**Bollard/pathway lighting**\" as a general concept is present elsewhere. What makes Chiyoda unique is the consistent use of *short, brushed-metal, round bollards with wrap-around diffusers and vertical Japanese writing*. Basic short pathway lights without these traits are **not unique**.\n\n4. **CAUTION:** \"**Absence of ornament/historic features, strict functional minimalism, and neutral colors (grey/black/bronze)**\" are all typical of most wards’ lighting schemes and cannot distinguish Chiyoda on their own.\n\n5. **CAUTION:** \"**Even spacing, proportional sizing to trees/buildings, and downward-facing lamp heads**\" are universal principles across all Tokyo wards and should not be considered a unique identifier.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n**The most reliably unique visual markers for Chiyoda street lighting are the very tall T-bar double-headed lamps on wide avenues and the short metallic bollard lamps with wrap-around frosted tops and vertical maintenance writing on pedestrian paths. Consistent, segmented, and purpose-specific deployment of lamp types is a further distinguishing trait. General modern minimalism, neutral colors, or utility-pole mounting are NOT unique to Chiyoda and should be used with caution when identifying this ward.**"

    "Certainly! Below is a **concise summary of the street lamp features that are truly unique or defining for Taito ward**, with **generic/shared features removed** and **cautions included** for any characteristics that are easily confused with other wards.\n\n---\n\n# **Taito Ward—Unique Street Lamp Features**\n\n## **Distinct/Defining Features (by elimination):**\n1. **Widespread Utility-Pole Integration and Extreme Density:**\n   - In Taito, *street lamps are fixed to nearly every concrete or metal utility pole*, creating an exceptionally dense, infrastructure-integrated network with highly visible overhead wiring—especially in side streets.\n   - This \"every-pole-lit\" integration is more intense and universal than in most other wards, producing a uniquely infrastructural visual texture throughout the ward.\n\n2. **Exclusive Reliance on Functional, Modern Minimalism Citywide:**\n   - No decorative, traditional, historic, lantern-style, or retro-inspired lamp designs are present *anywhere*, even in contexts (shopping arcades, parks, commercial streets) where other wards sometimes use such fixtures.\n   - No zone- or context-based variation: *the same strictly utilitarian lamps appear everywhere*—residential, commercial, and even newer pedestrian environments.\n\n3. **Distinct Wall-Mounted Shopfront/Entryway Lamps as a Routine Category:**\n   - Taito routinely uses *wall-mounted, small, simple round lamps with frosted diffuser glass* above shop entrances and commercial alleyways as a defined, recurring streetlighting group—not just as occasional one-offs.\n   - These lamps serve ultra-localized entry lighting (not general sidewalk/street illumination) and are considerably more prevalent than in most other wards.\n\n4. **Absence of Any Park-Specific/Bollard/Pathway or Median Double-Headed Lamps:**\n   - Unlike several other wards, Taito does *not* employ short bollard/path lights, dome-topped park lamps, dual-headed median posts, or any special greenway/landscape fixtures. All lamps, even in open spaces, are drawn from a minimalist infrastructure palette.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTION: Shared/Non-Unique Features**\n> These characteristics might seem descriptive, but **are broadly shared across Tokyo wards** and should NOT be used as unique Taito markers:\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The basic *modern minimalist design, lack of ornamentation, and neutral color palette* (grey, black, brown, metallic, pale green) is *standard in nearly all wards*.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   *Mounting lamps on utility/concrete poles* (with visible wiring) is *very common across Tokyo*—but the density and uniformity is what sets Taito apart.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   *Freestanding steel or aluminum posts with boxy/compact or oval heads* are also typical elsewhere.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   The *absence of banners, branding, or civic decorations* is not unique and is almost always the case in other central Tokyo wards.\n\n---\n\n# **In Summary—What Defines Taito and Prevents Misidentification**\n\n- **What to Look For**:  \n  Taito’s street environment is set apart by *the sheer infrastructural density of its utility pole-mounted lamps (virtually every pole is lit)*, the *unwavering lack of decorative/traditional lamp types in all settings*, **and the large-scale, routine use of small wall-mounted round shopfront lamps for local entry lighting**.\n\n- **What NOT to Use For Identification**:  \n  Neutral modern poles, lack of decoration, minimalist fixture shapes, and use of utility-pole mounting are all found in many other wards and are **not** distinctive.\n\n- **Cautions**:  \n  While the above general features could describe much of Tokyo, *the combination of maximal utility integration, citywide uniformity, and a uniquely common wall-mounted shop lamp* pattern is the best way to reliably identify Taito as distinct from its neighbors.\n\n---\n\n**If you observe strictly utilitarian streetlights on nearly every utility pole, plus regularly recurring small, wall-mounted round lamps above shop doors—**and absolutely zero decorative or traditional lamp forms—**you are almost certainly in Taito ward.**"

  "setagaya": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **concise summary of the street lamp features that are truly unique or most distinctive to Setagaya**, with general or widely shared features removed, and **cautions about features that could be confused with other wards explicitly listed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Street Lamps in Setagaya: Truly Distinctive Features**\n\n#### **UNIQUE AND MOST DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS**\n\n1. **Decorative Archway Globe Lamps at Shopping Street Entrances**\n   - Setagaya is known for installing **maroon or wine-red archways** at the entrances of shopping streets (**shotengai**), featuring **multiple opal white globe lamps** arranged in clusters or on trusses, *combined with neighborhood signage*. These lamp arches serve both as functional lights and prominent visual gateways, reinforcing local identity.\n\n2. **Extensive Use of Retro/Polygonal Lantern Lamps as Neighborhood Branding in Shopping and Pedestrian Zones**\n   - Double-headed **polygonal (hexagonal or octagonal) lantern lamps**—often on **dark green, maroon, or black poles** with subtle vintage features (finials, geometric frames)—are a significant marker of commercial and neighborhood centers in Setagaya. They support \"retro-modern\" visual branding and are more common and diverse here than in most wards.\n\n3. **Frequent Hybrid \"Modern-Classical\" Twin-Headed Posts**\n   - Setagaya exhibits a **high prevalence of modern-classical hybrid poles:** sleek black/dark brown posts with *two gently upturned arms* carrying geometric or polygonal lanterns. These are particularly common at the transitions between shopping and residential zones.\n\n4. **Stratified Lamp Typology for Local Identity**\n   - The **deliberate, context-driven layering** of lamp types by street function is more intense here than in typical wards: *utilitarian for residential lanes*, *distinctly decorative for shopping/pedestrian streets*, and *ultra-minimal for parks and gardens*.\n\n5. **Wall-Mounted Security/Entryway Lamps as a Widespread Parallel System**\n   - **Small, wall-mounted security sconces or domes** (downward-directed, compact, metallic or beige/white) are **ubiquitous on the exteriors of homes/shops** for hyper-localized illumination of narrow approaches, stairs, or alleyways—forming a parallel and highly integrated lighting \"ecosystem\" especially prominent in Setagaya.\n\n6. **Strong Use of Color-Coded Lamp Poles and Heads in Commercial/Identity Zones**\n   - Purposeful use of **maroon, dark green, brown, or muted green** lamp colors for retro/decorative fixtures to *visually signify* shopping streets and neighborhood borders (not just functional lighting, but local branding).\n\n---\n\n#### **CAUTIONS: “FEATURES THAT SEEM DISTINCT BUT ARE SHARED BY OTHER WARDS”**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The **dominance of utility-pole-mounted, minimalist lamps** (gray/silver/green, rectangular or oval heads amidst overhead cables) is **not unique** to Setagaya—this is a standard design across almost all Tokyo wards.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   **Standalone minimalist metal poles with compact modern heads** (gray, black, or silver posts; teardrop/box/disc/cylinder lamp heads) on wider/main roads and parks are **very common in other wards** (e.g., Minato, Meguro, Koto, Adachi, etc.).\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   **Short, ultra-minimal disc/cylinder pathway lamps for parks and gardens**, and **powder-coated wall-mounted sconces** are present in many other wards, although Setagaya may use them more systematically.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   Retro lantern-style lamps (polygonal/hexagonal, double-headed on dark poles) appear in *some* shotengai of other wards, most notably Ota, Suginami, Toshima, and Itabashi, so their mere presence is not enough for positive ID—it is the **variety, prevalence, and combination with archways and color-signaling** that is truly distinctive.\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary:**\n\n**What most distinctively marks Setagaya:**\n- The bold, frequent use of **globe-lamp archway entrances** (maroon arches with grouped globes and signage) for shopping streets.\n- The **extensive diversity and visual layering** of retro, colored, and hybrid lamp posts as neighborhood identity markers—especially polygonal twin-head lanterns on colored/ornate poles.\n- The **widespread parallel system of wall-mounted micro-sconce/building lights** for hyper-local pathway and entry lighting.\n- The **intentional stratification of lamp types by location/context**, supporting both practical and strong visual/community branding.\n\n**If you see a shopping street or pedestrian area where almost every lamp post is a polygonal double-head lantern, colored maroon/green, and especially if the entrance street has a maroon arch packed with white globe lamps and signage, you are very likely in Setagaya.**"

Here’s a **concise summary of truly unique, distinguishing features of street lamps in Suginami**, with **warnings/cautions about features that might seem distinctive but are also found elsewhere**. All general or common features shared with other wards have been removed or called out in the caution list.\n\n---\n\n# **Suginami Street Lamp Features: What’s Truly Unique**\n\n### **A. Distinctive, Suginami-Specific Street Lamp Types**\n\n1. **Low-Set Amber/Orange Dual-Globed Lamps**  \n   - Lamps on *short, white or off-white poles*, with *two compact, flattened amber/orange globes* mounted on a *gently arched crossbar*.  \n   - Specifically located in *narrow alleys* close to buildings.  \n   - *The combination of low height, white pole, flattened amber globes, and arched crossbar* in tight alleys is not reported elsewhere.\n\n2. **Green Twin Bell/Conical Head Lamps with Marker Balls**  \n   - Dark green poles featuring *two outward-facing, ribbed white conical (“bell-shaped”) lamp heads*.  \n   - *Occasionally includes a small green ball or ornament* beneath a lamp or the crossbar—used as a neighborhood/shop street marker, not as pure decoration.  \n   - *This specific combination and style are not found in other wards.*\n\n3. **Rare Retro/Victorian “Lantern” Lamps on Utility Pole Arms**  \n   - Black or dark gray, boxy, rectangular lanterns with *peaked/tent tops*, *mounted on arm extensions from utility poles* in certain pedestrian/shopping/“vibe” zones.  \n   - Style is *European/Victorian* rather than Japanese or Edo-period, and these are *deliberately used in select streets* to provide ambiance, not systematically spread citywide.  \n   - *Other wards often skip this type entirely, or when \"retro\" lamps appear elsewhere they are Japanese or different in design*.\n\n### **B. Minor but Noteworthy Suginami Patterns**\n\n4. **Context-Driven Use of Pole Colors and Tiny Ornaments / ID Balls**  \n   - Greater frequency of “accent” pole colors (such as *light blue, brown, white, or dark green*) especially for shopping/local identity.\n   - Lamps may have *small colored marker balls or ornaments* denoting neighborhood or street identity—always minimal and functional.\n   - While some other wards sometimes use colors or markers, Suginami’s application is *tied to specific local ambiance, especially in the twin bell/conical and dual-globe types*.\n\n---\n\n# **CAUTION: Common Features NOT Unique to Suginami**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The *basic modern, minimalist street lamp on slim metallic or utility poles* with rectangular, oval, or dome heads is the norm everywhere in Tokyo—this is NOT unique to Suginami.\n\n2. **CAUTION:** *Utility pole-mounted fixtures, frequent use of neutral/gray/brown/metal poles,* and focus on blending with surroundings occur in nearly every ward—don’t rely on these for identification.\n\n3. **CAUTION:** *Retro/lantern-style lamps* exist in other wards, BUT Suginami’s are uniquely European/Victorian, boxy, and peaked-topped—other wards’ “retro” lamps often look Japanese or have other design motifs.\n\n4. **CAUTION:** *Pole color accents* (blue, green, brown) sometimes occur in other wards, but Suginami’s frequency and use as neighborhood/shop identity for specific twin-lamp designs is more distinctive.\n\n5. **CAUTION:** *Twin/double-headed lamps* are seen in multiple wards, but Suginami's *specific low, white/amber dual-globe on arched crossbar in alleys* is unique; generic dual-heads elsewhere often use different shapes, heights, or color temperatures.\n\n6. **CAUTION:** The presence of *conical/bell-shaped lamps* is rare but not absolutely exclusive—always pair with marker balls/green poles for Suginami identity.\n\n---\n\n# **In Summary:**\n**The most distinctive street lamps in Suginami are:**\n- Short, white/off-white poles with dual flattened amber/orange globes (arched crossbar, tight alleys only).\n- Green poles with twin, outward-flaring bell/conical white ribbed heads, occasionally sporting a green marker/ID ball (shopping/pedestrian streets).\n- Rare black, boxy, peaked-top “Victorian” lanterns on utility-pole arms (not Japanese style), for select pedestrian routes.\n- Purposeful, local-context use of colored poles and small marker balls to denote local identity, especially with the above types.\n\n**Most other features—basic modern lamps, utility-mounting, minimal ornamentation, and neutral coloring—are standard across the city and NOT unique to Suginami.**  \n**Pay special attention to the exact color, lamp head shape, mounting height, and presence of green marker balls or specific lantern design to avoid misidentification.**"

  "minato": [
    "Certainly! Here’s a **concise summary of the features truly unique to Minato ward’s street lamps**—with any general/shared traits and possible “false positives” clearly marked as cautions.\n\n---\n\n# **Minato Ward Street Lamps: Truly Unique Features**\n\n### **Key Distinctive Features**\n\n1. **Strict Absence of Decorative, Retro, or Historic Styles**\n   - In Minato, **absolutely no decorative, ornate, retro, globe, lantern, or ‘Showa/Heisei nostalgia’ types** are present anywhere—including in parks, shotengai (shopping streets), bridges, or newly developed areas.\n   - **All lamps remain minimalist and contemporary**, even where other wards show exceptions.\n\n2. **Impeccable “Designer” Uniformity & Grouping**\n   - **Lamp color and form are deliberately and consistently tied to the immediate context**:\n     - **Matte black/dark gray**: Reserved for urban business and commercial corridors.\n     - **Metallic silver/light gray**: Exclusively used on expressways, river embankments, and major infrastructure.\n     - **Medium/dark brown, bronze, muted tan/gold**: Used only for bridges, landscaped streets, or premium pedestrian areas, and perfectly matched for visual integration with their environments.\n   - **No mixing of these groups**; each function area maintains its own, deliberately matched lamp style, resulting in a uniquely consistent urban-to-pedestrian visual zoning.\n\n3. **Occasional Use of Lamp Posts as Branded Vertical Signposts**\n   - **A rare but notable Minato specialty:** Some streetlights on commercial/shopping corridors double as lean, vertical branding signposts (e.g., “Merry road TAKANAWA”) using the same minimalist form.\n   - This specific integration of sleek, minimalist lamp and vertical branding is highly unusual in Tokyo—even when branding/signage occurs in other wards, it’s usually on decorative or retro lamps, not contemporary minimalist forms.\n\n4. **Absolute Lack of Utility-Pole or Multi-use Pole Lamp Integration**\n   - All classic Minato streetlighting is on **dedicated, standalone, slender metal poles**, even on residential backstreets and pedestrian bridges—there are **no lamps mounted on multi-purpose utility poles carrying visible cables, mirrors, transformers, or other infrastructure** (as is commonly found in nearly every other Tokyo ward).\n   - Visible “visual clutter” from wires or combos is a strong indicator *not* Minato.\n\n5. **No Visible Lamps on Some Streets**\n   - In several redeveloped, premium, or business-district corridors (especially in Minato), **no free-standing lamps are visibly present**—lighting here is either integrated architecturally, below eye-level, or awaiting installation. This \"invisibility\"—in such central/active urban spaces—is rare compared to other wards.\n\n---\n\n### **Cautions & Potential False Positives**\n\n1.  \n   **CAUTION:** The use of **slender cylindrical metal poles with minimalist, boxy, or dome-shaped heads in matte black, silver, or neutral brown** is also seen in nearly all central and western Tokyo wards—**this alone does not indicate Minato.**\n\n2.  \n   **CAUTION:** **Curved (gooseneck)/arched or right-angled lamp arms, and downward-facing compact lamp heads** are dominant across most of Tokyo. Minato’s use of these is not unique.\n\n3.  \n   **CAUTION:** **Integration with urban infrastructure** (e.g., poles used for traffic signals) is seen in Minato, but many other wards also have separate groups of such poles for signals/signs—don’t use this alone for Minato identification.\n\n4.  \n   **CAUTION:** The **absence of banners, planters, and decorative brackets** is a modern trend shared by almost every non-retro zone in Tokyo—it’s not a Minato-specific feature.\n\n5.  \n   **CAUTION:** **Brown/bronze/tan lamps for landscaped/bridge/pedestrian areas** are also present in some wards (but rarely as uniformly and context-deliberate as in Minato). If not paired with other unique features, this may not be conclusive.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\n**What is truly unique to Minato ward is an “absolute, uninterrupted, and context-driven modern minimalism” with:**\n- No decorative, historic, or globe/lantern lamps in any district or context (including zones where other wards make stylistic exceptions).\n- An unmatched, rigorously applied color-and-form zoning: every district uses lamps perfectly matched for type and environment, with no retro, multi-use, or ad hoc infrastructure blends.\n- Dedicated, contemporary poles—never shared with visible utility or telecom infrastructure.\n- **Occasional use of minimalist lamp poles as sleek commercial signposts** (not found elsewhere in Tokyo).\n- Sometimes, premium streetscapes have no visible lamp poles at all—an “invisible” safety lighting strategy emblematic of top-end Minato.\n\n**If you see any decorative, globe/lantern, or retro lamps, or if the lamps are mounted side-by-side with utility lines/signs/wires on concrete poles, you are definitely NOT in Minato. Minato’s distinctness lies in its disciplined, highly curated, context-zoned minimalism, and absolute exclusion of all historical, ‘local’ or decorative lighting cues.**"

    "Certainly! Here is a **distilled summary of truly distinctive street lamp features in Itabashi**, strictly removing general or commonly shared traits, **along with cautions about features that may be easily confused with other wards**.\n\n---\n\n# **Distinctive Features of Itabashi Ward Street Lamps**\n\n## **Truly Unique or Most Distinctive to Itabashi**\n\n1. **Consistent Use of \"Pseudo-Traditional\" Dark Green Lantern Lamps in Shōtengai/Shopping Streets**\n   - Style: **Elongated, hexagonal, dark green \"lantern\" lamps** (frosted/opaque panels, modest curved arms, sometimes a finial).\n   - Mounting: **Always utility-pole mounted** (rarely, if ever, standalone).\n   - Deployment: Prominently marks out shōtengai and local commercial/entertainment sectors rather than historical or park contexts.\n   - **CAUTION:** While other wards sometimes use green lanterns (e.g. Toshima, Ota), Itabashi's combination of single-head, elongated hex, dark green color, and pole-mount (never standalone poles or T-shaped arms) offers the most consistently applied, modestly decorative lantern style in commercial/arcade environments.\n\n2. **Frequent Use of Brown J-Shaped (Gooseneck) Modern Street Lamps on Major Roads**\n   - Style: **Brown-painted, large J-curve/“gooseneck” poles with elongated oval/capsule lamp heads**, sweeping over wide streets or medians.\n   - Context: Deployed primarily on Itabashi's main thoroughfares, acting as a signature for arterial/median lighting in the ward.\n   - **CAUTION:** Some wards employ J-shaped lamps (Kita, Nerima, etc.), but Itabashi's prevalence of brown (not gray or silver), and their systematic use on avenued medians/arterials, is especially notable.\n\n3. **Distinct Double-Headed “Box Lantern” Fixtures with Matte Black/Dark Gray Finish in Commercial Streets**\n   - Style: **Paired, cube-like, flat-topped box lanterns**, matte black or very dark gray, sometimes with minimalist deco/art moderne joining details.\n   - Context: Seen on commercial corridors; less reminiscent of the “twin-globe” types found in Ota or Bunkyo.\n   - **CAUTION:** While double-headed lamps are common in Tokyo, Itabashi’s specifically black/dark gray, squared box-lantern forms with mild deco styling set them apart (as opposed to globe or \"T-bar\" types elsewhere).\n\n4. **Overwhelming Near-Universal Use of Utility Pole-Mounted Lamps—Even for Decorative Types**\n   - **Nearly all lamps, regardless of style or context, are mounted on multipurpose utility poles** (often bearing visible wiring, signage, etc.), including “retro” and pseudo-traditional types.\n   - Where other wards might provide standalone posts for decorative lamps (especially for parks, commercial, or pedestrian strips), Itabashi **rarely if ever breaks this pattern**.\n   - **CAUTION:** Utility pole mounting is widespread in greater Tokyo, but Itabashi’s refusal to use standalone/decorative posts (even in specialty zones) strengthens its unique infrastructural identity.\n\n5. **Absence of Certain Styles Found Elsewhere**\n   - **No twin-globe \"milk glass\" decorative poles** (Ota, Bunkyo).\n   - **No wall-mounted, shopfront, or low bollard lamps** for pedestrian/park areas.\n   - **No European-style ornate lanterns or colored pagoda caps** (Ota, Suginami, Koto).\n   - **No archway or maroon gateway lamps at shopping street entries** (Setagaya).\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS—Features That Are Shared and Not Unique (Potential Misidentification)**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **\"utility pole-mounted, modern, boxy/oval lamps in gray, silver, or brown\"** is found in almost every Tokyo ward; this alone does **not** distinguish Itabashi.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **\"green pseudo-traditional lanterns in shopping streets,\"** is also present in wards like Toshima, Suginami, Ota, and others. What’s more distinctive in Itabashi is the **exact shape (elongated hexagon), consistent mounting (almost never T-arm, always pole-attached), and unadorned style**.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **\"double-headed lamp fixtures,\"** is common (globes in Ota/Bunkyo, disks in Koto, boxy in Itabashi), but only Itabashi consistently uses black/dark gray, paired box “lantern” heads with subtle deco cues.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, **\"brown J-shaped gooseneck posts,\"** can also be spotted in several wards, but Itabashi’s use is often more systematic and linked to arterial/median settings.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary—If You See:**\n\n- A **dark green, elongated hexagonal lantern** lamp (with mild curve/finial, no ornate T-arm), on a **utility pole**, in a shopping street—**likely Itabashi**.\n- A **brown J-shaped gooseneck pole** (with capsule head), especially deployed repetitively on main avenues—**likely Itabashi**.\n- A **matte black double box-lantern** (cuboid, flat-topped, deco styled) on a commercial corridor—**distinctive to Itabashi**.\n- Virtually **no stand-alone decorative lamp posts** anywhere, even for “special” lamps—**very characteristic of Itabashi**.\n- *No* twin-globe posts, ornate European lanterns, archways at shopping gates, or bollard/park post lamps.\n\n---\n\n**TRUE UNIQUENESS:**  \nItabashi’s most defining combination is its strict utility pole integration and a trio of localized specialty lamp types:  \n- **Green, elongated hexagonal lantern lamps for shōtengai** (never stand-alone posts);  \n- **Brown J-shaped lamps for arterials**;  \n- **Black or dark double square/box lanterns with subtle deco hints in commercial streets**—  \nall found squarely within a broader sea of function-driven, pole-mounted, minimalist Tokyo street lighting.\n\n**Use caution:** Standard gray, boxy, or capsule utility pole lamps, and even green lanterns, are not exclusive to Itabashi—it's the **combination and mounting consistency** that make these features distinct in the ward."

  "chuo": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **concise summary of street lamp features truly unique to Chuo Ward**, with **cautions about commonly shared features** removed or flagged.\n\n---\n\n## **Features Truly Unique to Chuo Ward**\n\n1. **Distinctive Wall-Mounted Lamps with Amber/Orange Covers**\n   - **Compact rectangular/trapezoidal wall-mounted lamps** attached high on building facades along dense urban sidewalks.\n   - Feature a **recognizable amber or orange-tinted diffuser/cover**.\n   - Used frequently for localized sidewalk and building perimeter illumination.\n   - **This wall-mounted, amber-lensed type is not found, or is extremely rare, in other Tokyo wards.**\n\n2. **Dual-Headed, Flat Disc Park/Promenade Lamps**\n   - **Slim, cylindrical dark brown or black poles** that bifurcate gently at the top.\n   - **Two minimalist, flat, disc-shaped lamp heads**, symmetrically attached and facing downward, usually along the length of riverside promenades, wide walkways, or parks.\n   - **No decorative or historic references**, even in these landscape areas—emphasizing streamlined, almost invisible lighting.\n   - **This specific dual-head, bifurcated, flat-disc lamp form is not a standard park/promenade solution in other wards; it is visually distinctive for Chuo.**\n\n3. **Extreme Uniformity and Lack of Decorative/Vintage/Retro Patterns**\n   - **Zero evidence of any lantern-style, globe, pagoda, or ornamental lamp forms,** even where such types might mark shopping streets, older neighborhoods, or parks in other wards.\n   - Lamp posts across all public spaces conform sharply to minimalist, modern forms, **without neighborhood/color accent variants or historic nods.**\n   - **This unwavering, context-insensitive uniformity (even in places where other wards diverge for “identity” or ambiance) is a hallmark of Chuo.**\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS: Common Features Easily Misidentified as Unique**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The use of **tall, metallic (silver/light gray), single-armed, minimalist pole lamps on main roads** is **extremely common across Tokyo** (Ota, Adachi, Koto, Minato, etc.), and should **not** be considered a unique feature of Chuo.\n2. **CAUTION:** **Dark-colored (black or dark gray) minimalist pole lamps at major intersections** are also **widely used in other wards** for functional urban lighting; this by itself is not unique to Chuo.\n3. **CAUTION:** **Absence of ornamentation, banners, or historic lamp styles** is the norm for the majority of central Tokyo wards and **does not distinguish Chuo from many others**—however, Chuo’s absolute refusal to introduce any local color or retro/contextual styling, even in parks and commercial areas, sets it apart.\n4. **CAUTION:** **Stand-alone, regularly spaced, utilitarian modern streetlamps** on sidewalks or major roads are shared by virtually all wards and do not alone define Chuo.\n\n---\n\n## **Concise Chuo-Unique Lamp Summary**\n\n- **1. Chuo Ward is uniquely identified by the consistent presence of amber/orange-lensed, wall-mounted lamps on building facades**—these are frequent in dense business or mixed-use areas and not characteristic of any other major ward.\n- **2. Chuo’s signature park/promenade lighting employs bifurcated, dual-head, flat-disc dark poles**—a highly modern, unornamented form not seen in the park spaces of other wards.\n- **3. The ward exhibits a level of modern, minimalist uniformity in street lighting unmatched elsewhere, with no exceptions for “retro,” “neighborhood,” or “historic” lamp types**—a nuance subtle but true, especially alongside shopping, residential, or park areas that often show local identity elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**If you see amber wall-mounts and dual-head bifurcated park poles—without a single hint of decorative or retro lamp forms, even in scenic or retail areas—you are almost certainly in Chuo Ward.**"

  "edogawa": [
    "Certainly! Below is a **concise summary of the features that are truly distinct for Edogawa street lamps**, with generic features and commonalities removed. This is followed by clear **CAUTION** notes about features that might seem distinctive but are also widely shared across Tokyo—so are not uniquely diagnostic of Edogawa:\n\n---\n\n# **Truly Distinctive Features of Edogawa Street Lamps**\n\n### **1. Prevalence of Pastel/Pale Green, Brown, or Beige Freestanding Poles**\n- Freestanding metal poles **in pastel/pale green, brown/bronze, or beige** are **prominent along parks, greenways, and certain sidewalks.**\n- This color palette (especially the regular use of **pale/pastel green** in both new and existing green zones) is visually distinctive for Edogawa, especially in comparison to “standard” grey or dark-colored poles used in most other wards.\n\n### **2. Highly Standardized Zoning by Lamp Type**\n- Edogawa maintains a **notable separation of three types:**\n  - **Utility pole-mounted lamps** with simple metallic heads (for residential roads)\n  - **Colored freestanding poles** (green, brown, beige) with disc/mushroom, globe, bell, or boxy heads (for parks/sidewalks/greenways)\n  - **Tall, slender “gooseneck”/shepherd’s crook poles** (in silver/metallic) with streamlined downlights (for boulevards/riversides)\n- This strict “by-location” standardization (especially colored poles in greenways/parks) is more consistent and systematic in Edogawa than most other Tokyo wards.\n\n### **3. Frequent Use of “Gooseneck”/Curved Poles for Major Roads and Riversides**\n- Tall, metallic, outward-arching “gooseneck”/shepherd’s crook poles **with a streamlined single head** are **used extensively** along major roads and riversides, often more so than in neighboring wards.\n- The prevalence and regular deployment of this style on open boulevards and waterways are especially characteristic of Edogawa’s urban structure.\n\n### **4. Complete Absence of Traditional, Decorative, or Retro Motif Lamps**\n- **Absolutely no use** of lantern-style, twin-globe “retro,” Victorian, or Japanese-historic motifs—not even in shopping streets or parks.\n- The modern, strictly functional, ornament-free aesthetic is maintained everywhere, setting Edogawa apart from several other wards that have even a few decorative, retro, or “local color” lights in commercial or historic areas.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTION: Features That Are NOT Unique (and May Lead to Confusion)**\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The key feature, \"**utility pole-mounted lamps with metallic oval/capsule/rectangular heads**,\" is also standard in very many Tokyo wards (e.g., Adachi, Sumida, Ota, Nakano). This **cannot alone distinguish Edogawa**.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   The presence of \"**minimalist, modern, unornamented lamps**\" is a **citywide Tokyo standard**. Other wards also have almost entirely functional, unembellished lighting.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   \"**Downward-facing fixtures, LED/fluorescent tech, and neutral/grey color palettes**\" for streetlights are **normal for almost all Tokyo wards** and do not differentiate Edogawa.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   The \"**use of concrete utility poles**\" as lamp carriers is extremely common across Tokyo’s eastern and northern wards. This is **not a unique identifier**.\n\n5. **CAUTION:**  \n   \"**Globe or bell-shaped park lamp heads on colored/dark poles**\" do occur in Edogawa, but similar park lamps (though seldom with green or beige poles) can also be seen in some other wards—so do not rely on head shape alone.\n\n---\n\n# **Truly Distinctive Identifiers for Edogawa**\n**In summary, the most uniquely diagnostic features are:**\n- **Frequent, systematic use of pastel/pale green, brown, or beige colored freestanding poles** (not just grey, black, or dark brown) for park, greenway, and sidewalk lighting.\n- **Widespread and regular use of tall, arched “gooseneck”/shepherd’s crook poles** for major roads and riversides.\n- **Absolute lack of any decorative/retro/traditional lamp styles**, even in commercial or shopping areas.\n- **Strict standardization by zone/context**, leading to a rare degree of visual cohesion between residential, park, and boulevard lighting.\n\nIf a Tokyo neighborhood features these **colored freestanding poles (especially pale green) in parks/paths, regular “gooseneck” pole lighting on major open roads/riversides, and a complete absence of any historic or decorative lamps anywhere**, it is very likely to be Edogawa.  \n**Beware:** Most “modern, plain” lamps, utility-pole-mounted ovals/rectangles, and basic grey/silver posts can be found in many other wards as well."

  "nakano": [
    "Certainly. Here is a **concise summary of features truly unique to Nakano street lamps**, with general/common characteristics filtered out, as well as a list of **CAUTIONS** regarding features that may seem distinctive but are shared by other wards and thus not unique to Nakano.\n\n---\n\n## **Truly Distinctive and Characteristic Features of Nakano’s Street Lamps**\n\n**1. Extreme Uniformity and Consistency**\n- Nakano’s municipal lighting exhibits *unusual design uniformity* ward-wide. Nearly all lamps follow a single typology: slender, straight (or very gently curved-top) metal poles painted metallic gray/silver.\n- All lamp heads are similarly compact and minimalist, mounted with a short, straight or gently curved bracket—variation in lamp head is extremely minor (usually teardrop, oval, or dome, occasionally “dish-head” in parks).\n- Unlike most other wards, there is *virtually zero contextual adaptation*: no decorative, retro, or historic styles, no integration with banners, signage, or other elements, and no neighborhood branding or color-coding.\n\n**2. The “Dish-Head” Park Lamp Variant**\n- Though not unique to Nakano within Tokyo, Nakano’s use of a minimalist, *wide, shallow cone (“dish-head”)* lamp head specifically for small parks or green zones is one minor, context-linked variation—but remains strictly stripped-down and gray.\n\n**3. Rare Muted Ochre-Brown Poles as Outlier Color Adaptation**\n- Very occasionally, Nakano features the *standard lamp pole design finished in a subdued ochre-brown* (brownish) tone for subtle blending in sensitive streetscapes or beside parks; this is always the same minimalist, municipal form as the standard silver/gray lamp.\n\n**4. Dedicated, Standalone Lamp Posts**\n- All lamps documented in Nakano are dedicated, free-standing lighting posts—*there is no routine use of utility-pole mounting, infrastructural sharing, or multifunctional poles* (i.e. for signage or urban tech integration), further reinforcing Nakano’s visual uniformity.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS (Features that Might Be Mistaken as Unique to Nakano But Are Not):**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The minimalist, modern, utilitarian design; metallic materials; and lack of ornamentation are *not* unique to Nakano and are widespread in Tokyo wards.\n2. **CAUTION:** The compact, downward-facing lamp head (forms: oval, dome, teardrop, bell, cylindrical) is also standard in most other wards.\n3. **CAUTION:** Gray/silver pole color as dominant is *citywide* for municipal lighting; the rare muted brown/ochre pole is found in other wards as well (e.g., Adachi, Minato, Edogawa).\n4. **CAUTION:** The “dish-head” lamp shape for parks, although common in Nakano, is equally used in other wards’ green space/public park lamps (e.g., Koto, Bunkyo, Edogawa, and others).\n5. **CAUTION:** A lack of ornamental, retro, or globe/lantern lamps is not unique—several other wards (e.g., Shinjuku, Shibuya Taito, etc.) also use only modern, unornamented designs in mainstream municipal lighting.\n6. **CAUTION:** Absence of wall-mounted, bollard-style, twin/globe, or utility-pole–mounted lamps is not completely unique (although several nearby wards use these types for functional/contextual reasons).\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n**What is most characteristic and closest to unique for Nakano is:**\n- An *exceptionally consistent, uniform modern streetlamp system*, with all fixtures being stand-alone, slim, metallic gray/silver (very rarely ochre-brown), with compact heads (oval/teardrop/dome, or park “dish-heads”), and utterly devoid of decorative, historic, retro, signage, or local-branding characteristics—applied identically throughout the ward with virtually no neighborhood adaptation or purpose-driven design variation.  \n- The total absence of pole multifunctionality (no lamps on utility or multi-use poles, no signage/cameras/media sharing).\n\nMost of these traits are seen elsewhere in Tokyo *individually*, but **the combination of near-total uniformity, absence of any utility-pole mounting or decorative types, and only the rare park or brown variant may help distinguish Nakano's lamps in a Tokyo-wide survey**.\n\n**Please note:** The few subtle variations you do see (park \"dish-heads,\" rare ochre-brown poles) are not truly unique and are easy to mistake for identification elsewhere. True uniqueness, if any, lies in *how consistent and monolithic the street lighting system is across urban, canal, residential, and park contexts.*"

  "katsushika": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **distilled, concise summary of street lamp features that are truly unique to Katsushika ward**, after removing general patterns and any features commonly found in other wards. **Common, modern, functional, utility-pole-mounted, and plain standalone lamps are not unique to Katsushika and are widely found elsewhere in Tokyo.** Explicit cautions are included to help avoid misidentifying general features as exclusive to Katsushika.\n\n---\n\n## **Features Truly Unique to Katsushika**\n\n### **A. Distinctively Unique Features**\n\n1. **Very Tall Highway/Expressway \"High-Mast\" Lamps**\n   - **Description:**  \n     - Extra-tall (10+ meters), metallic silver/light gray masts positioned in expressway or highway medians.\n     - Distinctive **T-bar or horizontal double-arm crosspieces** at the top, each supporting two or more **rectangular or compact boxy light heads**—providing exceptionally wide, uniform road coverage.\n     - No decorative elements; purely functional, and more towering/double-armed in appearance than highway lamps in most other wards.\n   - **Context:**  \n     - Almost exclusively used on major expressways/highways running through Katsushika.\n\n2. **Squat, Conical Ribbed Park/Canal Pathway Lamps (\"Bollard\" Lights)**\n   - **Description:**  \n     - **Waist-high (short)** posts—much lower than standard park/path lamps.\n     - Made of or surfaced to look like stone or concrete in **beige or light tan**.\n     - **Conical or pyramidal lamp head with a ribbed, translucent diffuser**—often weathered—mounted on a wide, sturdy base.\n     - Soft, ambient, ground-level illumination for parks, canals, and pedestrian walkways.\n   - **Context:**  \n     - Consistently installed along canal paths and greenways in Katsushika; almost never observed in this specific low, conical, ribbed, tan/stone style in other Tokyo wards.\n\n3. **Medium-Gray, Dual-Headed \"Retro-Modern\" (Not Historic) Street Lamps**  \n   - **Description:**\n     - **Tall, slender metallic pole** in medium gray.\n     - Splits at the top into **two short lateral arms**, each holding a **bowl-shaped (semi-exposed bulb) globe lamp head** facing opposite directions.\n     - Subtle retro-modern design: faint vintage cue but without ornamentation or classic lantern forms.\n   - **Context:**  \n     - Used in medium-density or older residential districts; not a common sight in most other wards (except for some that have *explicit globe or lantern-style retro lamps* which are more decorative than Katsushika’s purely functional retro-modern variant).\n   - **Note:**  \n     - Only a faint retro element; no full historic/vintage or decorative motifs.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS & WARNINGS**\n\n1. **CAUTION:**  \n   The vast majority of **utility pole-mounted, metallic/dark, rectangular/box-shaped, or capsule lamps are NOT unique** to Katsushika—these are the default for most Tokyo wards.\n\n2. **CAUTION:**  \n   **Smooth metallic or gray standalone modern posts** with dome or disk heads, without ornamentation, are extremely common citywide; do NOT use for unique identification.\n\n3. **CAUTION:**  \n   **Minimal ornamentation, utilitarian color palette (gray/black), and even the use of contemporary LEDs/boxy fixtures** are all shared by nearly every Tokyo ward.\n\n4. **CAUTION:**  \n   While the *dual-headed* lamp form can be distinctive, **many other wards have double-head or globe/bowl street lamps**—but usually these are either more decorative (lanterns, classic globes) or have distinctive colors/styles. Katsushika's dual-bowl type is distinguished by being *purely functional retro-modern* (medium-gray, no elaborate design, bowl shape with little decoration).\n\n5. **CAUTION:**  \n   Wards such as Adachi, Koto, Bunkyo and Toshima may have their own rare dual-globe or retro lamps, **but they differ in color, mounting, or ornamentation**. Only Katsushika pairs the medium-gray, bowl-headed, subtle retro-modern variant with practical functional purpose and minimal curves.\n\n6. **CAUTION:**  \n   **Low pathway/pedestrian \"bollard\" lamps** in other wards are usually dark/black, cylindrical or cuboid, and without conical/ribbed/beige features. Only the **squat, conical, ribbed, tan/stone pathway posts** are truly unique to Katsushika.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n**The most reliable, truly unique identifiers for Katsushika street lighting are:**\n\n- **A. The prevalence of ultra-tall, double-armed, high-mast expressway lamps with T-bar or wide horizontal arms and multiple rectangular heads (for highways/medians only).**\n- **B. Squat, waist-high \"bollard\" lamps for parks/canals, always tan/stone with a ribbed conical/pyramidal head—blending with the landscape, much lower than typical pedestrian posts.**\n- **C. Medium-gray, twin-bowl-headed \"retro-modern\" lamps, with two lateral, clean bowl-shaped heads on a single functional post, offering a faint nod to vintage but with a distinctly understated, modern, context-driven design (mainly in older medium-density areas).**\n\n**If these specific features are missing, the lamps are likely not unique to Katsushika and may be found, with minor variation, in most other Tokyo wards.**"

    "Certainly! Here is a **concise summary of street lamp features that are truly unique to Toshima Ward**, with all overly general or widely shared characteristics removed. **Cautions about possible misidentification** are clearly listed.\n\n---\n\n## **Toshima Ward—Truly Distinctive Street Lamp Features**\n\n### **Core Unique Features**\n\n1. **Green, T-Arm, Double-Headed Retro Lantern Poles in Shopping Streets**\n   - **Description**: Rare, purpose-designed street lamps:\n      - **Tall, slender dark green poles** with a decorative finial atop.\n      - **T-shaped horizontal arm** at the top.\n      - **Two square, lantern-style lamp heads**, each with a small “pitched roof” and framed glass or acrylic panels.\n      - Exclusively found in **traditional shopping arcades or historic districts**—deployed deliberately to create a “Showa-era” nostalgic ambiance.\n      - **Not used on ordinary residential, main, or park streets.**\n\n2. **Strict Segregation Between Lamp Types by District Function**\n   - **Functional, modern utility-pole lamps dominate most areas**: in clear, consistent contrast, **ornamental/retro lamps are strictly confined to shopping/historic streets**, never mixed into other street types.\n   - This sharp, deliberate division **(ubiquitous modern utility lighting vs. exclusive retro in shopping zones)** creates a local identity pattern unique to Toshima’s heritage/commercial pockets.\n\n### **Contextual/Deployment Pattern**\n- **Only Toshima** blends these two lamp types in this way:  \n    - Near-total function-first design *except* in historic shopping arcades, which receive the overtly retro green lanterns.\n\n---\n\n## **Cautions — Features That Are Shared with Other Wards**\n\n1. **CAUTION: The use of modern, functional, unornamented lamps on utility poles (gray, metallic, black, or brown; compact, downward-facing heads) is NOT unique to Toshima.**  \n   *Almost every Tokyo ward uses these as their default streetlamp type.*\n\n2. **CAUTION: Modern free-standing dark brown or black lamp posts with minimalist heads are common in many Tokyo wards, especially in redeveloped or open spaces, and not unique to Toshima.**\n\n3. **CAUTION: Retro-style, green-painted poles and lantern lamps do appear (with variation) in the shopping streets of several other wards (e.g., Itabashi, Arakawa, Suginami, Adachi, etc.).**  \n   *However, Toshima’s combination of green paint, T-arm with double square lanterns (pitched roofs, glass/acrylic panels), and strict use only in shopping arcades, is a distinct “recipe”—but any sighting should be checked against similar installations elsewhere.*\n\n4. **CAUTION: Context-driven lamp “zoning” (the use of ornamental lamps in commercial/shopping streets and functional lamps elsewhere) is a Tokyo-wide pattern; what is unique in Toshima is the particular design formula and consistent application.*\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Statement**\n\n> **Toshima Ward’s only consistently unique street lamp feature is its strict, context-driven deployment of dark green, T-armed, double-headed square lantern posts—purposefully retro, and found exclusively in shopping arcades and heritage streets to create Showa-era ambiance. All other lamp types (modern utility-pole, minimalist freestanding, color schemes, functional zoning) are standard throughout Tokyo and NOT unique to Toshima. Caution: Similar green retro shopping lamps do occur in other wards, but Toshima’s formula (green pole, T-arm, dual square lanterns) and rigid restriction to shopping streets are notable hallmarks.**"

Here is a **refined summary of street lamps in Sumida ward**, **removing all general or commonly shared information**, and providing **cautions about features easily confused** with those in other wards.  \n**What follows are the features that are truly distinctive to Sumida, with cautions included.**\n\n---\n\n## **Truly Distinctive Features of Sumida Ward Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Frequent Use of Distinct Salmon/Orangish-Beige Lamp Poles**\n   - On several roads, especially newer installations, Sumida uses slim, modern metal lamp poles painted a light salmon or orangish-beige not commonly seen elsewhere in Tokyo.  \n   - While many wards employ neutral or muted pole colors, this *particular soft salmon/orangish-beige* is rare and provides gentle regional distinction.\n\n2. **Occasional Use of Muted Blue-Grey Lamp Heads or Posts**\n   - Some newer, slim metal poles have lamp heads finished in a muted blue-grey, subtly distinct from common gray, black, or brown used citywide.\n\n3. **Strict Absence of Any Decorative, Historic, or Retro Motif Lamps**\n   - Sumida is consistently modern and minimalist even compared to other wards—there are **zero decorative, historic, retro, lantern, globe, twin-globe, or motif-driven lamps** anywhere, including shopping streets and parks.  \n   - No special lamp types are reserved for commercial/shotengai, parks, or “branding;” even color variations serve only as low-key neighborhood identifiers.  \n   - This near-total uniformity (with functional color accents) sets Sumida apart from even the most utilitarian other wards—where some rare decorative, retro, or identity lamps usually remain.\n\n4. **Heavy, Ongoing Use of Multipurpose, Unpainted Concrete Utility Poles**\n   - In dense residential alleys and backstreets, Sumida’s lamps are nearly always **mounted on unpainted, cylindrical, lightly textured concrete poles** that are multipurpose (lighting + dense overhead utility/telecom cabling).\n   - This concrete pole “type” is common in several wards, but **Sumida’s prevalence and persistence of this multi-use concrete pole, especially with minimal upgrades to modern metal in backstreets, is especially strong and widespread**.\n\n5. **Modern Metal “Gooseneck” (Curved Arm) Poles Often Used in Combination with Above Color Accents**\n   - While the gooseneck/shepherd’s crook shape is not unique, **Sumida frequently combines this form with the salmon or blue-grey color accent**, creating a visually distinctive but subtle neighborhood marker.\n\n6. **Distinct Double-Headed, T-Shaped Median Lamps for Expressways**\n   - In wide, median-divided roads and expressways, Sumida systematically employs **tall, slim, metallic T-bar lamp poles with two opposing, gently curved arms, each with a streamlined oval head**.\n   - While other wards may use double-armed lamps, **Sumida’s T-bar median lamp is more visually/structurally uniform, functional (never decorative/retro), and often paired with lane-wide concrete medians**.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTIONS: Visually Strong But Non-Unique Features**\n\n1. **CAUTION:** The use of **unpainted concrete utility poles with mounted lamps** is very widespread in Sumida but **is also common in several other Tokyo wards, including Arakawa, Adachi, Kita, etc.**  \n   - Do not identify a street as “Sumida” only by the presence of concrete multi-use lamp/utility poles alone.\n\n2. **CAUTION:** The general **slim, minimalist, modern metal lamp post with a gently curved “gooseneck” arm and boxy/oval head** is a feature found in almost every ward in Tokyo.  \n   - Only if this form is *paired* with Sumida's unique salmon or blue-grey color accents does it become suggestive of Sumida.\n\n3. **CAUTION:** **Double-headed median lamps** (T-shaped poles, two opposing heads) are present in other wards (e.g., Bunkyo, Chiyoda, and Chuo).  \n   - Sumida’s versions are notable for their uniformity and lack of decorative globes, but the basic T-bar form is not exclusive.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary: Hallmarks of Sumida Ward’s Lamps (Not Readily Confused)**\n\n- **Soft salmon/orangish-beige or muted blue-grey painted slim lamp poles (especially if paired with gooseneck arms and minimalist rectangular/oval LED heads).**\n- **Absolute lack of any decorative, motif, retro, historic, twin-globe, lantern, or “identity” lamps anywhere,** across all street types.\n- **Remarkably extensive use and survival of multipurpose, unpainted concrete utility poles with attached lamps** in old residential alleys.\n- **Double-headed, T-bar median lamps that are purely functional/streamlined (not globe/ornate)—** but note the caution above for visual double-checking.\n- **Signage limited strictly to small, utilitarian placards on poles**; never banners or illuminated street/area name signs.\n\n---\n\n**If you see a slim, salmon- or blue-grey pole, with a minimalist gooseneck lamp, on an otherwise visually undecorated Tokyo street, you are likely in Sumida. If you see any retro/ornate lamp, motif lamp, or notable “identity” lamp, you are NOT in Sumida.**"

  "meguro": [
    "Certainly! Here is a **distilled summary of features that are truly unique to Meguro's street lamps**, with general/shared traits removed. **Cautions about potential misidentifications** (i.e. commonly shared features) are clearly indicated at the end.\n\n---\n\n## **Features Truly Unique to Meguro's Street Lamps**\n\n1. **Prominent Use of Globe-Topped, Freestanding Lamps**\n   - Large, white or frosted globe diffusers on simple, metallic (often light gray) poles, typically positioned at pedestrian scale for area or sidewalk lighting.\n   - These globe lamps are *single* on each pole (not paired/doubled), unadorned, and found regularly across different street contexts.\n   - Unlike in other wards, globe-topped lamps in Meguro are a citywide pattern, not confined to parks or decorative zones.\n\n2. **Systematic Use of Muted Green Utility Poles for Urban Blending**\n   - Some utility or freestanding lamp poles are painted a muted, earthy green to visually merge with street trees or urban greenery.\n   - This color is used intentionally for context blending, not as a decorative accent, setting Meguro apart from most wards where green is rare, brighter, or found only on decorative/retro lamps.\n\n3. **Consistent Absence of Any Decorative, Historic, or Retro Lamp Types**\n   - *Nowhere* in Meguro are there lantern-style, pagoda, or retro-modern (twin globe, caged, or finialed) lamps—*not even in shopping streets, parks, or pedestrian zones*.  \n   - This exhaustive uniformity—strict, unornamented minimalism regardless of street, park, or commercial context—is exceptional compared to almost every other ward, which usually shows decorative lamps in at least some locales.\n\n4. **Distinctive Multi-Use Metallic Poles Explicitly Combining Lighting, Traffic Signals, and Regulatory Signage**\n   - Many intersections or roadways use silver or metallic gray multi-purpose poles where street lamps are directly integrated with traffic lights and signage—often with visible wiring and boxy, flat, or compact heads.\n   - While some other wards have occasional infrastructure-sharing, in Meguro this *systematic, visible consolidation* is much more pronounced, especially for major thoroughfares.\n\n5. **Utility/Concrete Pole Lamps with Gooseneck/Disc Heads, Muted Green Poles, and Practical Attachments**\n   - Lamp heads on unadorned concrete or muted green poles often use shallow disc (“saucer”) shapes, usually downward-facing, and may be set amid curbside greenery.\n   - These lamps can serve as hangers for municipal trash bags or signage—a specific, functional layering with no decorative context.\n\n---\n\n## **CAUTION: Features That May *Appear* Unique But Are Actually Shared**\n\n1. CAUTION: The use of **modern, minimalist lamp poles (black/gray, cylindrical with boxy or compact heads)** is **typical in many other wards** and is *not* distinctive to Meguro.\n2. CAUTION: **Freestanding street lamps and utility pole-mounted lamps** (including metal, concrete, or green poles) are **universal patterns in Tokyo**; alone, their presence does *not* signify Meguro.\n3. CAUTION: **Exclusive downward-facing, compact lamp heads** (cylindrical, rectangular, oval) are *commonplace* and cannot be used to reliably identify lamps as Meguro-specific.\n4. CAUTION: **The lack of decorative, historic, or ornate lamps** is also a feature of several other highly-modernized wards (e.g. Chiyoda, Taito, Adachi)—however, Meguro’s *across-all-contexts* uniformity slightly exceeds the general trend.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary:**\n\n**Meguro’s street lamps are uniquely characterized by:**  \n- Ubiquitous, single globe-topped, modern freestanding lamps for pedestrian/area lighting,\n- The systematic use of muted green utility/concrete poles for blending with city greenery,\n- A ward-wide, unwavering absence of any decorative or retro lamp styles (even in commercial/park contexts),\n- and the visible, routine integration of lamps with traffic signals and signage on multi-use metallic poles.\n\n**The above traits—especially the citywide prevalence of globe-topped lamps, green-pole blending, and total absence of ornamentation—distinctly set Meguro’s lamps apart, even amidst Tokyo’s broader trends toward modern, utilitarian lighting.**"
