However, CAUTION: functional, modern lamps are generally shared by many eastern Tokyo wards on expressways and river crossings and are not always exclusive to Katsushika. Yet, Katsushika's signature of very tall river bridge expressways, visible from the Skytree angle, and strict absence of colored or decorative lamps makes it the best fit here. Thus, the truly unique feature is the combination of ultra-functional tall highway lamps on a major river bridge in clear view of eastern Tokyo landmarks.</reasoning>\n<ward>Katsushika</ward>",

There are freestanding modern street lamps with a gentle outward curve (gooseneck design), a neutral grey color, and simple, downward-facing lamp heads. On the left there are residential homes and maintained hedges, while on the right is a green embankment and some pedestrian fencing. The lamp posts themselves are slim, tall, and appear to be quite standardized and functional without ornamentation or neighborhood branding.</observation>\n<reasoning>Based on the observation, the modern, functional design of the street lamps, their freestanding (not utility-pole-mounted) nature, and the lack of decorative elements are widespread in Tokyo, and especially characteristic of wards with a strong focus on functional or infrastructure-related areas.\n\nA key feature to consider is the presence of tall, metallic, gently curved \"gooseneck\" lamp posts on broad arterial/expressway roads or alongside riverbanks. This is quite distinct for wards like Edogawa, which is known for frequent, systematic use of such gooseneck/arched lamp designs on major boulevards and riversides—often with green spaces or embankments adjacent. The pastel or pale green, brown, or beige pole colors found in Edogawa do not seem to be visible here, but the lamp color still matches possible variants. The total absence of any decorative, retro, or localized lamps further matches Edogawa, where there is an absolute uniformity of modern functional lamps even in green zones.\n\nCAUTION: The general combination of freestanding, arched/gooseneck lamps and neutral colors can also be found in several other wards (Koto, Sumida, etc.), so it is not entirely unique, but Edogawa is particularly distinctive for this approach in open, infrastructure-heavy corridors beside embankments or rivers.\n\nThus, given the combination of context (major road with embankment, modern infrastructure, and green spaces) and the lamp style, the most likely match is Edogawa.</reasoning>\n<ward>Edogawa</ward>",
